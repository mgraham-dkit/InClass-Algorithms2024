Action: Search for a specified value in a supplied array
Input: Array to be searched, value to locate
Output: Position at which element was located

// VALIDATION:
If array is null:
    Throw new exception (e.g. IllegalArgumentException)

// Bonus validation: ONLY for use if incoming value to locate is an object!
If object to locate is null:
    Throw new exception (e.g. IllegalArgumentException)

// SET UP:
Create variable to track start of data to be considered and set it to 0
Create variable to track end of data to be considered and set it to array.length-1

// LOGIC:
while start <= end:
    Calculate midpoint of data as start + (end-start)/2
    if array[mid] equals value to be found:
        return mid
    if array[mid] < value to be found:
        set start to mid + 1
    else:
        set end to mid - 1

// OUTPUT:
return -1 as no match was found
